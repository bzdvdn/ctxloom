"""knowledge produce — routing, search, evidence, calculation, lifecycle.

Module layout mirrors the pipeline stage by stage (§48):
`router` (greeting vs research) → `search` (fan-out + text/table materialization)
→ `evidence` (extraction + claim verification) → `calc` (structured-data
aggregation) → `lifecycle` (turn overseer + answer builder). `common` holds the
shared deterministic helpers. The package re-exports every Produce class so the
agent containers keep a flat import surface.
