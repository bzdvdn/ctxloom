"""The flagship demo question ("how much does gpu cost in total?") run with
`llm=None`: search, table resolution and the sum aggregation are all
deterministic (§67), so the exact total and its provenance can be asserted
without a model in the loop at all — proving the number in the answer came
from `gpu_usage.csv`, not a guess."""
