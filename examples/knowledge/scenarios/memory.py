"""Multi-turn: chat memory carries over to a follow-up question.

`BuildAnswer` (`produce/lifecycle.py`) only feeds `conversation_text(...)`
into the LLM prompt — with no model configured, the deterministic fallback
answer ignores it entirely, so a purely `llm=None` run can't show memory
changing the *answer text*. What it can prove, fully deterministically, is
that the memory window itself is correctly populated by the time a
follow-up would need it: this scenario calls the pipeline's own
`conversation_text()` helper against the accumulated `Context` after two
real turns — the exact call `BuildAnswer` makes for the second question.
