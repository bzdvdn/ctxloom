"""devops produce — routing, domain reports, reply rendering.

Mirrors the pipeline: `router` (question → LLM agent's problem artifact) →
`reports` (ToolAnswer of each agent → domain report) → `reply` (report →
chat reply). `common` holds the routing helpers/fallback lexicons. Flat
re-exports keep the agent containers' imports stable.
