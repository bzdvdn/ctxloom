"""ctxloom.patches — the `Patch` container (§12, §24).

`Patch` is the runtime's *transport*: an ordered set of `operations` (defined in
`ctxloom.operations`) that gets applied as one commit. The authoring surface of
produces is `self.effects`; a `Patch` is built by the runtime (compiling the
effects slot), by `Effects.to_patch`, and by custom `Agent.run` implementations
that assemble a change-set by hand (the escape hatch).

The Operation types and `operation_from_dict` live in `ctxloom.operations` and
are re-exported here for backward compatibility.
