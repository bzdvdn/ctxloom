"""recipes — ready-made search fan-out (§8, §24, §42).

Effects-based: fans out over every configured source and *writes* the ranked,
idempotent `SourceRef`s into the current produce's `effects` slot instead of
returning a patch to merge by hand. Returns the scoped refs so the caller can
inspect/rank them and add its own marker effect (e.g. `SearchDone`).
